# YouTube Controls

The extension provides simple control over YouTube video. It is meant to provide a better experience of watching videos IN ADDITION to the current player. It is NOT meant to allow users to edit or download YouTube videos, only for them to control playback more easily.

YouTube Controls was originally created to allow college students to watch YouTube webcasts more efficiently. The current YouTube video player allows a maximum playback speed of 2 and locks the skip rate to 5 * playbackRate. Any more control is only possible through the JavaScript Console or editing the Source files of the video, both of which are time consuming and esoteric.

YouTube Controls provides the following functions:
- Play/Pause: Play or Pause the video while using the Browser Action
- Speed Control: Set the exact playback rate of the YouTube video
- Skip Rate Control: Set the skip rate of the YouTube video to $5\*playbackRate$; for example, if the skip rate is 5 and video playback rate is 2, then skipping forwards once will skip through 5 seconds of playback and 10 seconds of the video
- Keyboard Skipping: Use the commands Alt+Left and Alt+Right (or set your own shortcuts) to skip during playback

Users can set different settings for each tab they have a YouTube video open on.
